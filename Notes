    a block chain is a book that is continuously growing list of records
    called blocks which are linked and secured using crypto cryptography.

First Block

So here we've got block number one.

It's also called the Genesis block in a box in the first block and it's called jazzes block because

after the block chain is initialized that block will always stay blocking them on forever and ever and

ever for eternity it will never change.

That's no other block will become the once.

This block is always going to be the first one.

That's where it all originate.
